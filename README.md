# Lunar Pilot

A basic Svelte game I made inspired by [this game](https://ehmorris.com/lander/).

[A bit more information available on my website.](https://www.dominicdoty.com/2023/07/30/lunarlander)

This was my first "serious" webdev project - so go easy on me please ðŸ˜€.

This game was also featured on [Hackaday](https://hackaday.com/2024/08/16/lunar-lander-game-asks-you-to-write-a-simple-autopilot/)!

## Game

[Available Hosted Here](https://lunar.unnecessarymodification.com/)

The object of the game is to write a simple autopilot (in JS) that can land you lander on the moon.

The game features a range of "difficulties" in the form of different starting conditions and lander behaviors.

## Development

Setup should be as simple as running `npm i` and then `npm run dev`
